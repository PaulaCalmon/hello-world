# hello-world
you say good-bye...


Write a bit about yourself? Why? How? I can say many things about myself but would they be useful? For what and whom?
I miss Orkut where people/friends would write "Testimonials" about us. That was cooler... especially because back then I was a teenager. I miss the early 2000s. Had I learned more about programming then, I would definitely have had a totally different career path. Here I am, trying to figure this whole thing out at the age of 36.
